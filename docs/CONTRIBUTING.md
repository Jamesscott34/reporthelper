        """Set up test data."""
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username='testuser',
            password='testpass'
        )

make quality
```

### Example Code Style
```python
"""Module docstring describing the purpose."""

from typing import List, Optional

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

from .utils import process_document


class Document(models.Model):
    """Document model for storing uploaded files.
    
    Attributes:
        title: The document title
        user: The user who uploaded the document
        created_at: When the document was created
    """
    
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def process(self) -> Optional[dict]:
        """Process the document with AI.
        
        Returns:
            Processing result dictionary or None if failed.
        """
        try:
            return process_document(self.content)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
            return None
